In this project we practice simple concepts like linear regression algorithm and Gradient descent optimization variants like SGD and Adam. 
The data used for this project is about electric power consumption in Tetouan, Morocco. 
We started by Explotary data analysis to study the relations between the predictors and the target variable. Then we train the linear regression model by three different methods: Ordinary least squares, Stochastic gradient descent optimizer and Adam optimizer.
lastly, we draw the error curve during the training process for the last two methods.
